- term: ADC
  category: Electronics
  summary: Converts analog signals to digital values.
  details: >
    An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) samples an analog input and outputs
    a digital code representing the signal amplitude at discrete time steps.

- term: Bit Depth
  category: Imaging
  summary: Number of bits used to represent each pixel.
  details: >
    Higher bit depth enables more precise representation of tonal values and
    reduces banding artifacts in gradients.

- term: Chromatic Aberration
  category: Optics
  summary: Color fringing caused by lens dispersion.
  details: >
    Occurs because different wavelengths of light refract by different amounts
    when passing through a lens element.
